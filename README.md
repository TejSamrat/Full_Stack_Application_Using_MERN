# Full Stack MERN Application with Playwright Testing

## Overview
This project involves developing a full stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). Additionally, Playwright will be used for end-to-end testing to ensure reliability and cross-browser functionality.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**
  - A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
  - Ideal for handling large volumes of unstructured data and scaling applications seamlessly.

- **Express.js**
  - A web application framework for Node.js.
  - Simplifies the development of server-side applications with robust routing, middleware support, and database integration.

- **React**
  - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Enables the creation of reusable UI components and efficient rendering with its virtual DOM.

- **Node.js**
  - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
  - Allows for server-side scripting and building scalable network applications.

- **Playwright**
  - An open-source framework for automated testing of web applications.
  - Supports testing across multiple browsers, such as Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, with a single API.

## Project Goals
- **Build a Robust Backend**
  - Develop RESTful APIs using Express.js to handle CRUD operations.
  - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  - Integrate MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Create a Dynamic Frontend**
  - Design a responsive user interface using React.
  - Implement state management with React hooks or state management libraries like Redux.
  - Ensure a seamless user experience with interactive components and real-time updates.

- **Automate Testing with Playwright**
  - Write comprehensive end-to-end tests to cover all critical user flows.
  - Validate the applicationâ€™s functionality across different browsers and devices.
  - Integrate testing into the development workflow for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional web application with a robust backend, a dynamic frontend, and thorough testing coverage. Using Playwright for automated testing will ensure your application maintains high quality and performs consistently across different environments.
